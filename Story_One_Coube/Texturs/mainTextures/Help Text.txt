Hi! Thanks for purchasing my item.

This set is ideal for your pixel based platform games.

Instructions for locating your wanted sprite:

The folder titled "Sprites(Still gifs and pngs)" contains all the unanimated tiles.
The folder titled "Characters and Sprites(Animated)" contain all animated sprites and characters.
The folder "Background tiles" contains all tileable backgrounds for game use in .gif format.
The file "Sprite sheet.psd" contains all tiles on one canvas side by side
The file "32x32 sprite set.psd" contains the same tiles in the same 32x32 dimension.

Thankyou. If you have any problems, contact me via my profile on graphicriver.net
